        `   
            <p> I dabble in almost every digital realm you can imagine. From proggramming to audio production, with stops at game development and 3D Modeling in between, I have had an intrest in computers since I was seven years old. Over the cource of my life since then, I have a verity of diffrent art pieces to display. On this page I will be showcasing my photography from the past few years, an art form I have recently found an intrest in. Above I have some of my favorites on display. I hope you enjoy. </p>

            <!--- I put in this paragraph just to explain what's happeneing with the calculation underneath... it's all fake -->
            <p style="color: white"> I take photo requests, as well as sell stock content. I only charge ten bucks for each photo I sell. But there's a twist! I also charge a start up fee of forty dollers upon signing up as a customer. This means that if you're looking for a single photo, that'll run you 50 bucks flat. However, if you're looking to purchase more than one photo, your cost formula would like this C(x)=10x+40. Use the built in tool below to calculate how much it would cost to buy a specifc amount of photos!</p>
